# StepLearn
A Machine Learning project on applying Markov decision processes and Q-Learning on robot movement model.

The idea is to apply Q-Learning technique to a two-legged robot, whose goal is to move forward (rightwards) as fast as possible.
The program allows you to change robot's legs' size and position of knees; then you can start monitoring its learning process. 

Some examples of robot's movement after learning stage:
